# Virtual Minds Coding Challenge

## Note
All tasks are containerized and automated using `make`

## Getting Started
The whole project contains 3 Makefiles, `task 5 and 6` have their own `Makefile` and their `readme`, please refer to them for task 5 and 6 respectively.

     Makefile in the root directory is explicit for task 01, 02, 03 and 04

## Make
The following command pull, start and run the tasks. Each task output is displayed with a different color, and after successful execution, the container is removed.
```sh
$ make run-task-1-4
```
